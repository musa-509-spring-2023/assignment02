/* The "stop_desc" column shows the review of the closest cheesesteak
store within 1 km of each rail stop. The cheesesteak review is gratefully
provided by the Philadelphia Cheesesteak adventure at
https://www.facebook.com/ridesharejim/. The dataset was on the persional
website, but the domain has expired. It was updated until Nov 2021.
Theoriginal dataset contains scores and review for each ingredient
(meat, veg...) of the cheesesteak. Enjoy!
