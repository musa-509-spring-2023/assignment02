/*
Rate neighborhoods by their bus stop accessibility for wheelchairs.
Use Azavea's neighborhood dataset from OpenDataPhilly along with an
appropriate dataset from the Septa GTFS bus feed. Use the GTFS documentation
for help. Use some creativity in the metric you devise in rating neighborhoods.

NOTE: There is no automated test for this question, as there's no one right answer. With urban data analysis, this is frequently the case.

Discuss your accessibility metric and how you arrived at it below:


*/

/*  Accessibility metric:
    -The number of accessible bus stops (with presence of wheelchair boards),
    -The proximity between the bus stops and to health service center,
    including hospital (for example, Penn Medicine), schools and universities
    (for example, in this case, Upenn or Meyerson Hall).
