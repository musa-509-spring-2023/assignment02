/*
You're tasked with giving more contextual information to rail stops
to fill the stop_desc field in a GTFS feed. Using any of the data sets
above, PostGIS functions (e.g., ST_Distance, ST_Azimuth, etc.),
and PostgreSQL string functions, build a description (alias as stop_desc)
for each stop. Feel free to supplement with other datasets
(must provide link to data used so it's reproducible),
and other methods of describing the relationships.
SQL's CASE statements may be helpful for some operations.
